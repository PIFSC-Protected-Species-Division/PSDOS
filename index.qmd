# Protected Species Division Main Page 

(Come up with a fancy title? Use Moceatle image or something less weird?)

PSDOS (said like MS-DOS) = PSD Open Science (not that we need another acronym... but I think just calling us PSD Open Science Team/Crew/Gang or something like that is descriptive but not too fancy or weird :) 

Short blurb about who we are.

Intro blurb about what the page is that reflects:

-   Members of PSD have joined the growing [NMFS Open Science Community](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/) through participation in [NMFS Openscapes training](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/)

-   As in other fields, open science practices can advance protected species science by making it more accessible

-   This site aggregates our efforts to make our data, resources, and tools more available

-   Please join us - here's how!

-   Other things?
