The Marine Turtle Biology and Assessment Program (MTBAP) conducts research throughout the central and western Pacific Ocean to support the conservation and management of threatened and endangered marine turtle populations. The program works to understand the distribution, abundance, trends, movements, habitat use, and population dynamics of numerous populations of turtles from five species, as well as the impacts of anthropogenic activities such as fisheries bycatch on each population.
