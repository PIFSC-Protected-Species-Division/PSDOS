    "text": "The Protected Species Division (PSD) of the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center provides the scientific foundation for the conservation of cetaceans, Hawaiian monk seals, and sea turtles in the Pacific Islands, guided by mandates of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, Endangered Species Act, and international agreements.\nMembers of PSD have joined the growing NMFS Open Science community through participation in NMFS Openscapes training. As in other scientific fields, open science practices can advance protected species science by making it more accessible, transparent, and reproducible. This site will serve as a hub for PSD Open Science (PSDOS), where we will aggregate links to our datasets, analytical tools, and other resources for ourselves, our collaborators and stakeholders, and other researchers and analysts.\nThe PSDOS hub is a work in progress that we intend to grow and develop in the months and years to come. If you have suggestions for resources or other information to include, please let us know by creating an issue in the PSDOS repository."
